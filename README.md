A 6x4" (15x10cm) single sided supercomputer PCB designed to fit into a picture frame. It has a USB powered 6x9 grid of LEDs, each with its own resistor.
I would suggest 220 ohm resistors and 5mm diffused flashing LEDs, but a random mix of static colours or slow RGB looks good too.
The PCB can accommodate either 1206 sized surface mount resistors or quarter watt through hole resistors.

Used for the memory view portal.

The main focus is on the Raspberry PI pico module

Coding is done with CircuitPython. inspirational thanks to Adafruit(esp. DanH for the Asyncio)

to be added the schematics and photos.
